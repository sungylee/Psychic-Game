You're going to make a game just like the one in the video. Essentially, the app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. Put the following text on your page:
Guess what letter I'm thinking of
Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)
Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)
Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)
Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)
When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).
When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).


Possible Variables
Wins
Losses
Guesses Left
Your Gusses So Far

1) When the player wins, increase the Wins counter, and start the game over again(Without refresh)
2) When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game over again (Without refresh)


When loads and game is automatically started with information displayed asking user to guess what letter
computer is thinking of:

Computer selects a random letter.
Letter gets stored in variable(Computer pick)
User is ask to guess what letter
User presses a letter on keyboard
For every key presses
make all keys into lower case

Compare user key matches computer's pick
IF guess is correct
    Alert user won
    Add 1 to Wins
    Erase everything from gusses so far (do not erase anything else)
    Make computer select a new random letter

IF guess is incorrect
    Guesses left is reduced by 1
    Guessed letter is added to Gusses so far
        IF guesses left = 0
            Alert user lost the game, and tell the user what the coputer randome picked letter is
            Add 1 to Losses
            Erase everyting from gusses so far
           Make computer select a new random letter
